# base
I have choose to use react for managing render, reflow, and states. 
I used create-react-app since it has basic codes for single page application and testing. From that, I removed unneeded code. 

# css
Since I do not need pretty layouts, just added css to create desirable layout and used it with className. 

# components
I made Card component for showing each data in the seed data and Products component for controlling data and managing logic.
